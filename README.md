This project focuses on creating an Employee Management System (CRUD System) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main functionalities of the project include:

1- Adding Employees: Allowing users to input employee details such as name, age, department, and salary, and storing them in a list.
2- Displaying Employees: Showing all added employees in a table format.
3- Updating Employee Information: Allowing users to modify the details of a specific employee.
4- Deleting Employees: Enabling users to delete a specific employee or clear the entire list of employees.
5- Searching Employees: Providing a search function to filter employees by name.
The stored data is kept in the browser's Local Storage, ensuring that the data persists even after the page is reloaded.
